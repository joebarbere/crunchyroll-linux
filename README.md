# Description:

This is a Linux port of the [Unofficial Tizen Crunchyroll App](https://github.com/jhassan8/crunchyroll-tizen).

> **Fork note (mouse & keyboard support):** This fork adds full mouse and
> physical-keyboard support to the TV-style interface. Hover to highlight,
> click to select/play, right-click to go back, and scroll to navigate lists;
> arrow keys / Enter / Esc drive every screen and you can type your email,
> password and searches on a real keyboard. The upstream "Cursor and keyboard
> is not supported" message is removed. Controller support is unchanged.
> See [`server/js/electron/pointerSupport.js`](server/js/electron/pointerSupport.js).

# Install

## Manual Install

Download the latest AppImage from [releases](https://github.com/aarron-lee/crunchyroll-linux/releases)

Install it with an AppImage manager, my recommendation would be [GearLever](https://flathub.org/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever), but other alternatives like AppImageLauncher also works

## Quick Install

run the following script in terminal:

```
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/crunchyroll-linux/raw/master/install.sh | sh
```

When GearLever opens up, make sure to Unlock + move the app to the app menu

## Steam Deck / Bazzite / ChimeraOS Installation

Follow the [quick install](#quick-install) instructions, and afterwards also add it to Steam as a non-Steam game.

**IMPORTANT** set the Crunchyroll resolution to 1080p in the Steam game settings, otherwise it won't scale well.

**The app should have basic controller support working, but if you prefer to use Steam Input to manage navigation, make sure to disable `Game Controller Support` in the Crunchyroll app's settings, and set a controller config in Steam Input.**

Then, in game mode, make sure to enable a Steam input community controller layout. It might require you to show all available layouts while selecting the layout.

I've tested the `Streaming Controls` Steam input community layout by Bleiodes, which works fairly well.

Also, in the Steam Game settings for the app, set the resolution as 1080p. The App was not designed for higher resolutions, you may see visual bugs at higher than 1080p resolutions.

## Flatpak install (experimental)

flatpak currently requires a manual install, a flathub submission is being investigated.

See instructions here if you want to manually install the flatpak: https://github.com/aarron-lee/flathub/tree/crunchyroll-linux

# Controller Support

Note that the app has built in native game controller support.

However, I personally find that I prefer Steam Input for controller management, rather than the native game controller support.

To use Steam Input do the following:

1. login to the crunchyroll app
2. In the Crunchyroll app settings, disable the game controller support setting
3. If not already added to Steam, add the Crunchyroll app to Steam. Then, in Steam, make sure Steam Input is enabled for the crunchyroll app.
4. Look for a a community controller profile for the app, but if none is available, you can manually map a layout.
5. Map the following keyboard keys for the minimal mappings required for navigation:

- Enter to A (Playstation X)
- Esc to B (Playstation Circle)
- D-pad to Keyboard arrow keys

# Development

node and npm are required dependencies.

run `npm start` for to run the app.

There is no hot-reloading, so you must re-run the command after code changes are made.

## Build

run `npm run electron-build`

This will generate an AppImage in `electron/dist`

## FAQ

Q: How do I enable full screen while in desktop?

A: you can press the `f11` key to fullscreen the app. alternatively, add the env var `FULL_SCREEN=1` to the application

## Troubleshooting

If videos fail to load, try deleting your config directory and restarting the app.

To delete the config directory, run the following in terminal:

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.config/crunchyroll-linux/
```
